Forked from <a href="https://github.com/DeepKariaX/Cryptographic-Algorithms-Python">DeepKariaX/Cryptographic-Algorithms-Python</a>

Various Cryptographic Algorithms made using python.


## Prerequisites:
Make sure that you have the following:
-  Python 3+ and pip (which comes with Python 3+)
-  Some requires different libraries so be sure to install before run
-  An environment to work in - something like Jupyter or Spyder

## Terms:
-  E denotes Encryption
-  D denotes Decryption
-  Some have both E&D and some have only E.

## Algortihms:
-  Caesar Cypher Algorithm
-  Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm
-  Hill Cipher Algorithm
-  Monoalphabetic Cipher Algorithm
-  Playfair Cipher Algorithm
-  Playfair Cipher Algorithm (Custom Alphabet)
-  Rail Fence Algorithm
-  RSA Algorithm
-  Vernam(OTP) Cipher Algorithm
-  Vigenere Cipher (Repeat & Auto Key)
